# MMA-Gender-Analysis
How does gender affect peformance in UFC fights?

In this notebook I explore this question by looking at a sample of female and male UFC fighters, and compare their striking stats, grappling stats, and fight results.

The analysis I perform suggests that gender does indeed affect some key aspects of MMA performance. Looking at some key striking and grappling stats, we see female fights are higher paced, with a higher strike rate and more time spent grappling, whereas men's fights involve more measurable damage, specifically more knockdowns, knockouts, and submissions. Other areas showed no significant difference, e.g. strike accuracy, submission attempts, etc.

This is my first exploratory data analysis in Python, so all feedback is appreciated! As this is my first analysis, I wanted to practice using the main data analysis suite: Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. I also wanted to demonstrate my SQL experience, so throughout this notebook I query the data using the built in Pandas function pd.read_sql.
